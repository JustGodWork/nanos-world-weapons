# nanos-world-weapons
Default nanos.world Weapon's Package

## Usage
This is a built-in Library already included in nanos.world, to use it, just include ``Package.RequirePackage("NanosWorldWeapons")`` on the top of your scripting. You do not need to clone or download this package to use it.

```lua
NanosWorldWeapons.AK47(Vector(123, 456, 100), Rotator())
```

## Full Example

```lua
-- Includes this Package in your Package
Package.RequirePackage("NanosWorldWeapons")

-- Spawning the AK47
local my_ak47 = NanosWorldWeapons.AK47(Vector(1035, 154, 300), Rotator())

-- Adds a StaticMesh Attached with a RedDot mesh into AK47 on sight_socket bone from AK47 model. As our AK47 model already
-- have a bone named sight_socket at the right location, we can just attach to it, otherwise we would 
-- need to set it's Attach Location to where the RedDot fits and using bone name as empty ""
my_ak47:AddStaticMeshAttached("sight", "NanosWorld::SM_T4_Sight", "sight_socket")

-- Makes the FOV multiplier reduces by 0.35x when ADS (aiming)
my_ak47.SightFOVMultiplier = 0.35

-- Sets the ADS transform offset to fit the RedDot center position,
-- each weapon will need a different offset to fit it's sight. AK47 + RedDot best fit is Z = -15.9 
my_ak47:SetSightTransform(Vector(0, 0, -15.9), Rotator(0, 0, 0))
```

Note you can use any Static Mesh and attach to the weapon, also you can use any Skeletal Mesh and build you own weapon.
